Create a file called testShell00 in your submission directory.

• Figure out a way for the output to look like this (except for the “total 1” line):

touch testShell00
chmod 455 (r-- = 4, r-x = 4+1, r-x = 4+1)
touch -a -m -t 202206012342.00
echo "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA" > testShell00

• Once you’ve achieved the previous steps, execute the following command to create
the file to be submitted: tar -cf testShell00.tar testShell00

tar -cf testShell00.tar testShell00

**Test**

tar -xvpf testShell00.tar
ls -l
check permission
check count link
chech bit
check time modify  "stat -x testshell00"
