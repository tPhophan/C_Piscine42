In a midLS file, place the command line that will list all files and directories in your
current directory (except for hidden files or any file that starts by a dot - yes, that
includes double-dots), separated by a comma, by order of modification date. Make
sure the directoryâ€™s names are followed by a slash character.

1. touch midLS
2. echo "ls -m(,) -t(soft by time modify) -p(followed directory by /)" > midLS

**Test**

bash midLS
